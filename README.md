**My Personal Projects**

This repository consists of a few simple projects, that I tried out for my learning purpose. I came across these projects online and found it interesting. 

Below are the projects in this repository:

**1. Get Weather Data**

  Get the current weather data by typing in any city name

**2. Hangman Game**

**3. Random Password Generator**

**4. Downloads Manager**

  This project helps to clean up and manage your downloads folder and move the respective files to its own category folder. For example - all pdf files in your downloads folder will be moved to a new folder named 'folder_pdf'
